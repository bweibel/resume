<p>I am applying for the Software Engineer position posted on LinkedIn. I have over 10 years of previous experience as a web developer on small teams and at start-up companies, which makes me a good candidate for this position.</p>
<p>As a Front-End Developer and Co-Founder at Redtail Design Co., I worked closely with our designers, developers and our clients to build responsive websites, custom Wordpress templates and plug-ins from scratch. I was responsible for deploying web sites from conception to production. Most of my work was done using frameworks like Wordpress and Angular. Our main clients were Ohio University, as well as the Ohio Brewers Association, and we worked with many breweries around the state. 
</p>
<p>Before starting Redtail Design, I worked for Electronic Vision, where I started as an intern and moved on to do QA testing and bug fixing for software and websites. Eventually I was hired as a full time developer.  In this position I built responsive websites from static design mockups using modern, semantic HTML, JS, and PHP. I frequently met with clients to discuss and determine the needs of their project. After finishing projects I trained clients on updating and managing their sites, as well as providing ongoing technical support and maintenance after project launch.</p>
<p>I was also the co-founder of a startup called LiveInteractive. Here we built a mobile app and webapp focused on being a digital billboard for local events. I led the webapp and advised the backend team, both made up of 2 other developers. The webapp was built using angular, with a  custom “event poster creator” module built using the canvas API.</p>
<p>I believe my experience completing projects, delivering websites, and working directly with designers and clients will make me a great candidate for your software engineer position. Feel free to contact me with any questions about my qualifications.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration,<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Ben Weibel <br>
